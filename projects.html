I have participated in many scientific projects in companies and schools, such as Few-Shot Segmentation and Self-Supervised Visual Representation. 
The main projects are as follows:

          <strong>Weather Forcasting (2023.06-2024.01)</strong>
          
          <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>GNN: </strong> We try to build a global weather forcasting system with AI model, 
            which seems the global weather signals as a Latitude and longitude graph. 
            We design a GCN model to forcast the global weather.

          <strong> <a href="https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/medium-range/skno">SKNO:</a> </strong>
            We design a new SKNO model, which integrates the KNO model and SHT operator. 
            SKNO is developed based on the 16-year assimilation reanalysis dataset ERA5 and 
            can forecast global weather with 6-hour temporal resolution and 1.4-degree spatial resolution, 
            including temperature, humidity, wind and other indicators.
            The related research has been pushed in [<a href="https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience/tree/master/MindEarth/applications/medium-range/skno">code</a>].

            <strong> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10348598">SPPEL</a> : </strong>
            Different from the general prompt learning with extra-prompt support, 
            we try to design a model with the  prompt support from the input of it. 
            The related work has been accepted by TCSVT.

            We design a new model to fuse different contents from learnable branch and frozen backbone and 
            achieve SOTA in 8 standard benchmarks for PASCAL and COCO datasets with different backbones (ResNet50 and ResNet101). 
            The related research has been received by TOMM.

            Further explore lightweight few-shot segmentation models. With a parameter of 0.68M, 
            the model shows good performance on Cross-class, Cross-dataset and Cross-domain tasks.

            <strong> Self Supervised Learning: </strong>
            We design a model with higher accuracy and lower computation to encode visual signal. 
            Finally, when GFLOPS were reduced to half of the vit-base, 
            the model performance did not significantly degrade.
